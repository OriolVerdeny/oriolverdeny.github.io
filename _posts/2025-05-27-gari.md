section1:
  title: "Overview"
  content: |
    * **Type of project:** Early-stage business concept study.
    * **Objective:** To evaluate the feasibility of establishing a small semi-industrial gari production unit in Benin, with the goal to modernize production methods, improve profitability, and ensure positive social and environmental impacts. 
    * **Key Outcomes:** Project feasibility, production and market analysis, financial modeling, and strategic recommendations. 

section2:
  title: "The Challange"
  content: |
    Cassava is an important food and cash crop in Benin, contributing significantly to both food security and local economies. Gari, a processed cassava food product, is widely consumed as a cheap staple across West Africa. 
    
    Traditional gari production methods in Benin are labor-intensive, inefficient, and difficult to scale. This project explored the feasibility of a modern, semi-industrial approach to improve efficiency, product consistency, while ensuring positive social and environmental impacts. 


section3:
  title: "Approach"
  content: |
    The study combined fieldwork with theoretical analysis.
    
    ## Fieldwork
    
    On-site visits and interviews were conducted to:
    
    * Understand traditional gari production process.
    * Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the process.
    * Identify stakeholders and map the cassava value chain.
    * Explore existing markets and sales channels.
    
    This approach provided a deep understanding of how transformation is organized, what are the production practices, how products are distributed, and the supply chain logistics.
    
    ## Theoretical Analysis

    The analytical component included:

    * A review of relevant literature and past development projects related to cassava value chain and gari production.
    * A 3-statement financial model (Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow) used to simulate profitability under various production and economic scenarios.
    * A techno-economic analysis, combining process modeling, equipment sizing, and economic calculations.
    * A market analysis focused on cassava production dynamics and supply availability in Benin, the demand of gari, existing semi-industrial processing units and the challenge they face, transportation logistics, and market structure –pricing dynamics, competition, and sales channels–.

section4:
  title: "Value Delivered"
  content: |
    
    * Identification of opportunities and constraints for modernizing traditional gari production in Benin.
    * Financial estimates of potential investment and operational requirements.
    * Highlighted critical risks and success factors through scenario modeling, interviews, and literature review.
    * Decision-making support for future investors, entrepreneurs, or development partners.
